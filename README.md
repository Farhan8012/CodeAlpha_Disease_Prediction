# Disease Prediction System (Heart Disease)

## Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on medical attributes such as age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure. It uses Machine Learning algorithms and a Streamlit web interface for easy user interaction.

## Features
* **Data Analysis:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with correlation heatmaps.
* **Model Comparison:** Compared Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
* **Best Model:** Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved ~90% accuracy.
* **Web App:** Interactive dashboard built with Streamlit.

## Tech Stack
* Python
* Scikit-Learn, XGBoost
* Pandas, NumPy
* Streamlit (for the interface)
